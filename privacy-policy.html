<p>Casino Clic is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. The following statement describes the information collected by Casino Clic.</p>

<h2>What information do we collect and why?</h2>

<p>To play for real money at Casino Clic, we need your name, email address, postal address, credit card number, and expiry date. This information allows us to process all your credit requests quickly and accurately.</p>

<p>When you take part in a promotion or competition, we may ask for your name, email address, and postal address so we can contact winners. You may opt out of any communication you do not wish to receive from us.</p>

<p>When you participate in a customer survey, we may ask for your name, email address, and other personal information. We do this to ensure that we build and modify our casino according to our players' wishes.</p>

<p>We closely monitor player traffic and site usage to help us develop and improve the design of our websites.</p>

<p>We may use your IP address to diagnose problems that may occur with our server and to administer our website. Your IP address is also used to gather general demographic information.</p>

<h3>Advertising system</h3>

<p>Our advertising system detects IP addresses to provide more targeted advertising information, such as banners in specific languages. It does NOT record email addresses.</p>

<h3>Opening an account</h3>

<p>The account information provided during the account creation process is strictly confidential and for our own protection. We do NOT share this information with any third-party company or organization.</p>

<p>This information includes your email address and other personal details provided during registration. If you provide us with your personal data, the information will only be used for its intended purposes, such as enabling us to send you withdrawal checks and other information you request.</p>

<p>Email addresses are NOT shared with any other organization for commercial or non-commercial purposes. Email addresses will only be used to provide our customers with information regarding new software releases, promotional materials, and various casino operations, such as deposits and withdrawals.</p>

<p>We collect the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email.</p>

<h3>Winnings</h3>

<p>Your winnings and withdrawals are strictly confidential, and your winnings information is kept in a secure environment. Casino Clic keeps your winnings information private and does not provide this information to third parties unless required to disclose it by law or by any competent governmental or regulatory authority.</p>

<h2>What are your rights over your personal data?</h2>

<p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force on May 25, 2018, you have a number of rights regarding your personal data, which are detailed here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Right of access to personal data:</strong> You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you. Please visit the Contact Us page to get in touch if you wish to make such a request. In the Contact Us form, provide as much information as possible to identify yourself and help us collect the information.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to erasure:</strong> You can ask us to erase your personal data when we are not legally required to continue keeping it. This right only applies in certain circumstances, as legal obligations include data retention periods.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to rectification of personal data:</strong> You can request that we correct any personal data we hold about you that is incorrect.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to be informed:</strong> When the application of a right on personal data has an impact on your personal data, you have the right to be informed.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> Similar to the right of access to personal data, this right allows you to obtain your personal data in an electronic format that would allow you to transfer it to another organization, if necessary.</li>
  <li><strong>Right to restrict/object to the processing of personal data:</strong> In certain circumstances, you have the right to object to or restrict the processing of your personal data when such processing is based on consent or our legitimate interest. Despite objections, we may continue processing where there are legitimate grounds or legal obligations.</li>
  <li><strong>Rights related to automated decision-making and profiling:</strong> You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing when that decision has legal implications or significantly affects you. We do not make automated decisions of this nature.</li>
</ul>

<p>You also have the general right to withdraw consent given to process your personal data for marketing activities or when processing is based on our legitimate interest.</p>

<h2>Data protection outside the European Union</h2>
